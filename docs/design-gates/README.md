# Design-gate policy

Design gates freeze compatibility-sensitive decisions before implementation is
allowed to depend on them.

## Required scopes

The contribution checker currently recognizes these scopes:

```text
public-api
core-library-boundary
```

A pull request touching a protected path must add or update an approved gate in
this directory. The gate file name must match `*-DG-v*.md` and contain:

```text
**Status:** Approved
**Scope:** public-api
```

or:

```text
**Status:** Approved
**Scope:** core-library-boundary
```

A gate must state the exact contract, accepted alternatives, rejected
alternatives, compatibility impact, tests, and approval evidence. Draft or
proposed documents do not authorize protected changes.

## API freeze

Increment 11 will create the first Nodal public-API gate. Increment 9 establishes
only the enforcement mechanism; it does not freeze any public API itself.
